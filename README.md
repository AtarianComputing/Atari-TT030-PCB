# Atari-TT030-PCB
A re-creation of the original schematics and PCB layout for OpenBoardView use using KiCad. 

This project started in 2018 and has been dormant for several years. I have tried to get back to it, but I just haven't had the time. I have now updated it to be used with KiCad 8. 

**This is very much incomplete. The schematics are complete but need to be verified. However, there are many ERCs that are mostly about power and pin compatibility (output connected with output). Not all small components have footprints. No routing has been attempted**

My method was overlaying each sheet with the original schematic and painstakingly tracing the original as best I could. If best practices aren't followed, that might be another reason, besides my inexperience.

The components were similarly placed using an overlay of the PCB as a guide, and I'm satisfied that it's close enough to use with OpenBoardView. The BRD file in the repo is the latest OpenBoardView file of the PCB.

This project should be an easy start to actually re-creating a complete PCB.
